### Aarhus Artist Underground
*Exam Project: Fall 2022 / Hidden places*
By Deen Rotaru


### Summary:
   A website that aims to present locations in Aarhus meant to serve as art presentations. People are able to suggest a location to be researched and added to the “master doc” on the website, the only requirement is for the places to not be classic galleries/museums.
    Each location gets a subpage themed around the subject(only keeping the structure of the main page) and 1-3 useless interactions the users can do.
(*an interaction that does not serve any other purpose besides a small entertainment value for the users)
